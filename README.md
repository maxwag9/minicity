This is my first city game in python inspired by Cities Skylines. 

Longterm goal is to switch to Rust and make a better, more performant CS2 kind of game! 

This game is just there for me to learn about the technicalities of the CS backend, leaving out the graphics for now.
Yes, graphics are optional. Maybe there will be graphics, maybe not...

Goal is to "Build a simplified city simulation prototype that simulates a tilemap with roads and zones. Visuals are optional. Focusing on simulation logic, data structures, and modular code."

With that out of the way, let's get this interesting coding experiment started!

Here is the notion page for my programming goals with this project: https://www.notion.so/239d1f43448d8065995df2c790d2011f?v=239d1f43448d800d974f000cc08d8c04&source=copy_link


Note that I only know python and will slowly get into rust. Any help is welcome!
